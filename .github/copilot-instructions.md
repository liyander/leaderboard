# Leaderboard System - Custom Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack leaderboard system built with:
- **Frontend**: React.js with Vite for fast development and modern UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for REST API
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Features**: User management, random point claiming, real-time leaderboard, claim history with pagination
